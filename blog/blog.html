            <h4>Pitch Presentation & Gameplan</h4>
            <p>
                This was a fairly stressful week, as we had to get our pitch presentation ready for Wednesday. <br>
                We were well prepared, so it wasn't too bad, but it was still a bit stressful as we aren't too used to presenting. <br>
                We had to make a slideshow, and a video, and the prototype needed to be playable in front of the audience. <br>
                There was luckily no technical issues, and the presentation including the prototype went smoothly. <br>
                <br>
                After we finished the presentation, we had a meeting on friday to discuss our gameplan for the next few months. <br>
                Firstly, we decided to use a new git repository, as the old one was a bit messy. <br> As I'm the build engineer, I was tasked with setting up the new repository. <br>
                I also went over how to use Github for the artists to make sure they were comfortable with it, and there were no issues. <br>
                <br>
                Since I pitched the game idea, I've taken initiative with a somewhat leadership role. I've been making sure everyone is on the same page in the project, and I've been making sure everyone is doing okay, <br>
                and I've been trying to keep the team morale up. <br> After we pivoted games, team morale was a bit down, but after the presentation <br>
                and a few meetings, everything has started to go extremely well. I'm very happy with how the team is working together, <br>
                and I'm excited to see what we can do. <br>
                <br>
                Here's the slideshow that I mostly completed on my own that we used for the presentation. <br>

                <br>

                <br>
                Finally, here's a video of the prototype that we had a week to make. <br> 
                It turned out really well! <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                This is a gameplay loop that I created to show off what we plan on creating; the video goes over a few of the core mechanics. <br>

            <h4> The Game Pivot</h4>
            <p>
                 This week had an interesting turn of events. On monday, we handed in our One Pagers for each of our game pitches, <br>
                 and we were given the go ahead on our robot-roguelike later that night by the professor. <br>
                 However, he also said that he really liked our 2nd game pitch idea, and gave us the <br>
                 option to switch to that one if we wanted to. <br>
                 This was an extremely difficult choice, as we'd be doing this project for the next 8 months <br>
                 and we had already started on the robot-roguelike prototype. After an emergency team meeting, <br>
                 and lots of discussion, we decided to switch to the 2nd game idea, "Project: Abyss" <br>
                    <br>
                 This game idea was actually my original idea, and I was very excited to work on it. <br>
                 I was also very excited to work on the robot-roguelike, but I think this was the right choice. <br>
                 Here's the 3 One Pagers.
                    <br>
                    <button class="toggle-button" id="toggleButton4">See One Pagers</button>
                    <iframe id="pdfViewer" src="../One-Pagers.pdf" width="1080" height="720" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="display: none;"></iframe>

                <br>
                We then had to fully pivot to this game. We had to restart the prototype from scratch, <br>
                and make sure everyone was on the same page. I took a bit of lead and decided to make a game design document <br>
                to make sure everyone was on the same page. People were definitely a bit stressed out from the switch, <br>
                but I think we're all excited to work on this game. After some working on it over the week, <br>
                we got almost all of the prototype done by sunday night. <br> 
                Here's the documents we worked on. 
                <br>

                <br>
                I'm extremely happy with all of my team members, and I'm excited and confident in our ability to make this game. <br> <br>
                Signing off, <br>

            <h3><em>Fri, Sept 15, 2023</em></h3>
            <h4> The Prototype Grind</h4>
            <p>
                This week started off eventful as we had to begin to narrow down our game choices. By friday,  <br>
                we had decided on a game idea. The voting method we used was elimination voting, where we would vote for<br>
                 our top 3 games, and then the top 3 would be discussed in depth. <br>
                We would then vote again, and the game with the most votes would be the one we would go with. <br>
                <br>
                We've settled on a captivating concept for our game: a robot roguelike shooter with upgradable robot components and intense enemy encounters. <br> 
                The deadline is approaching swiftly, as we aim to have a compelling pitch and a playable prototype ready by Monday, the 24th. With our game concept locked in, <br> 
                it's full steam ahead as we dive into prototype development and prepare our pitch. Additionally, we've designated roles within the project, and I've taken on the role of build engineer.<br> 
                 This means overseeing git merges and ensuring a functional build is available for our professor to assess every week. It's a weighty responsibility, but I'm ready to take it on. <br>

                 Here are some pictures of the white board we used for the voting and brainstorming. <br>

                So what's next? <br>
                Our Jira was setup, and we will be using that to keep track of our tasks. <br>
                We will be using Unreal Engine for our prototype, and we will be using a temporary github to get a head start on some of the programming. <br>
                We also need to remember that UML diagrams and design docs need to be done as well. <br>

            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h3><em>Fri, Sept 8th, 2023</em></h3>
            <h4>The Project Begins</h4>
            <p>This blog will be semi casual, mainly used as a way to document progress throughout capstone, and keep myself organized. <br>
                I'll be updating it every week on Friday, with the occasional bi weekly update if stuff is busy. <br>
                <br>
                This week we formed our teams, and had our first meeting. <br>
                I was chosen as one of the two "team captains" who had to pick who would be on my team, dodgeball style. <br>
                Needless to say, it was nerve wracking, but I was happy to have a team of people I know and trust, <br>
                as well as a few new faces I was looking forward to work with. <br>
                <br>
                Our first meeting was mainly introductions, and getting to know each other. <br>
                We also discussed our project, and what we wanted to do, and were tasked to bring games to the meeting <br>
                that were similar to what we wanted to make. I brought Subnautica because I adore deep sea games,<br>
                and I think it would be a fun challenge to make something similar. <br> 
                Here is a write up of a game pitch I created for the Subnautica inspired game. <br>

                For next week, we will be setting up our Jira board, and getting our project proposal ready. <br>
                I'm looking forward to getting started on this project, and I'm excited to see what we can do! <br>
